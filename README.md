# iris_dataset
This project focuses on flower identification
This dataset is from http://www.kaggle.com/uciml/iris
The dataset has 150 rows and 6 columns.
I have utilized basic machine learning algorithm to predict specie of flower.
For this classification, I learnt a new concept- Decision tree.
I split the dataset into training and testing dataset, implemented the decision tree classifier algorithm on the training dataset and tested the accuracy with testing dataset and the matplotlib library for the decision tree visualization.
